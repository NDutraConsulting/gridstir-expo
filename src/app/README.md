# APP
This is where all the application logic lives.

## Consider Package deployment
This needs to be deployed using a package so that required-updates are consumed by all branded applications automatically.

## Cloud based package deployment
Consider cloud based deployments of this layer for hotfix's and AB-tetsing...\
I think Apple frowns upon this and I am not sure what the protocol is around cloud based deploys.\

## App Approval challenge
Getting an application approved can take up to 2 weeks which is an eternity in the software business.
